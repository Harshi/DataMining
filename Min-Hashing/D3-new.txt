earlier this week electronic arts outlined the free and paid dlc coming to star wars battlefront in the coming months the plans run through the entirety of  with the fourth and final season pass expansion  still without details  coming in early  one would hope with disneys first spinoff film  rogue one a star wars story  releasing in december of this year that the fourth expansion pack could contain some content from the movie its possible but ea isnt quite ready to commit just yeton star wars the one thing that we are adhering to and i think this is part of our arrangement with lucas and disney is you cant make a game in star wars that violates the canon of star wars meaning you can take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless its a reference ea cfo blake jorgensen explainednot knowing yet exactly what the storyline in rogue one is going to be i cant comment on how that could come in but to the extent that its in the future around our current battlefront game is all paced based on the historical star wars canon which is  years before the most recent movie he continued the most recent referring to star wars the force awakens which takes place  years after return of the jedidespite releasing around the time of the force awakens eas star wars battlefront is thematically designed with the original trilogy in mind but does include some content that explores the battle of jakku which takes place shortly after the battle of endor jordgensen added that the period in which battlefront is set limits the studios ability to brings ome new content into that in fact its the reason we wont see any force awakens dlc in this particular battlefrontstar wars rogue onethat being said ea did leave open the possibility of rogue one dlc if they can make it so it doesnt violate the canonobviously were trying to stay tightly connected to the star wars beat for future movies and we will obviously in future star wars games be able to tap the new characters and vehicles and so forth but in our current game and for that matter the dlc associated with that current game obviously we will have to be careful that we dont violate the canon jorgensen saidthough it would take some crafty thinking it is possible for rogue one to be added as dlc depending on the exact setting of the film we know the movie is set prior to the events of a new hope but we dont know how much before just yet we also know it centers on a band of resistance fighters who unite to help steal the plans to the dreaded death star so technically it could still tie into the whole original trilogy canon star wars battlefront has goingthe problem in my opinion lies with battlefronts heroes although darth vader is rumored to make an apperance we dont know about the other original characters such as luke skywalker princess leia han solo or any of the other heroes in battlefront that would make playing as them on rogue onethemed maps tricky especially if ea is forced to adhere to canon that being said if ea can figure out a workaround like not allowing particular heroes on a rogue one map then i dont see why it couldnt workif anything its possible we could see a focus on the new trilogy with the next battlefront because we all know theres going to be a sequel

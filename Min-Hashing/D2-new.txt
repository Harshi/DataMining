rogue one a star wars story remains cloaked in mystery however now that star wars the force awakens has started to settle down a bit details of the upcoming spinoff film set in the days before the original star wars and following the rebel soldiers who steal the death star plans should soon start to trickle out at reasonable pace soon being the key word there in the meantime we have to rely on whatever the rumor mill has been churning out and the rumor mill has been very busy rumors and details and whatnot as always anything that comes out of the rogue one rumor mill should be be taken with a grain of salt until we hear something official anything can change anything can be based on outdated information etc anyway this new batch of assorted bits of business comes to us courtesy of jo blo you should hit that link for all of the details but well run down the basics here the film will supposedly feature deathtroopers stormtroopers with all black armor that from the sound of their name are probably up to no good there will be a droid character who is being described as a scene stealer supposedly a former imperial droid who turns his loyalties elsewhere this could very well be the mocap character alan tudyk is playing one of the characters is supposedly named cashen and there will be variations on tie fighters and atat walkers featured in the film and finally they double up on the previous rumors that darth vader will be in the film saying that his role is larger than originally thought theres nothing too concrete there but the concept of black suited deathtroopers certainly seems to gel with the buzz that this will be a darker slightly harsher star wars movie than we have seen before also we can think of few things that intrigue us quite like tudyk playing an off killer droid darth vader strikes back while jo blo says darth vader will have more to do in the film than expected making star wars claims to know the details it seems that former anakin skywalker will see some serious action in the film and well get to see first hand why everyone in the galaxy fears this guy beyond him having a scary mask and a scarier voice the frequently reliable site says that multiple vader costumes have been built for the production the hero suit that must stand up to scrutiny in closeups and stunt suits that will be used for action scenes but what kind of action scenes wellthe action sequences filmed are unknown but there was work pitching the different ways darth vader could kill rebels on a battlefield with the force and his lightsaber the storyboard pitches showing decapitated rebels people being dismembered by vader throwing his sword levitating bodies to make human shields and so on the art was more violent than what weve seen darth vader do on screen beforeyikes the original trilogy never truly showcased vaders skills in all out conflict so seeing a sith of his power at work could be terrifying and its about time vader stopped being a cuddly corporate mascot and started being a nasty piece of business again alan tudyk speaks speaking with comic book resources the wonderful alan tudyk did not confirm whether or not his motion capture character is a droid with shifting allegiances but he did give the requisite being on a star wars set is amazing speech that every actor is obligated to give however the always self deprecating actor gave his version a little twist its amazing going to work  even though its difficult you always hear that film acting there are moments wheres its very cold and you have to where something that isnt necessarily warm and hours days or more but when youre doing star wars you are looking around at all the magic thats around you and it sparks the kid in you it immediately goes away or at least within an hour or two at least around lunch itll go awaythis man is a national treasure nay a galactic treasure he great donnie yen best known for his genuinely badass work in various chinese action movies is playing another one of rogue ones unknown characters we know from carefully examining the lone cast photo that his character appears to be blind which is very interesting indeed anyway he recently participated in a reddit ama and had this to say about the film i think its really flattering to be the first chinese actor in the star wars universe and i have full confidence rogue one will do extremely well because the force is with meis it possible and this is just conjecture that yens character is a blind warrior who excels in battle because he has some connection to the force perhaps not enough to be a jedi but enough to give him an edge chew on that until we hear more advance photos smuggled out of the nuremberg toy fair have have revealed that a few costumes from rogue one will be on display when the doors open to the public this weekend a cursory glance confirms that these outfits look very much like the ones worn by felicity jones diego luna and donnie yen as seen in the official cast image judge them via the tweets below

Min-Hashing:

This execise was done to understand the use of k-grams, Jaccqard distance and Min-Hashing in the context of document similarity.

In the code,
Step 1:
We have 4 example documents. For each document, I constructed
1. 2-grams based on characters
2. 3-grams based on characters
3. 2-grams based on words

Step 2:

I found the jaccard similarity of each pair of documents based on each k-gram model. 

Step 3:

Built a min-hash signature based on the 2-gram based on characters model.

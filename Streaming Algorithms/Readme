Streaming Algorithms

Misra-Gries Algorithm
Given a long stram of input that can only be examined twice, the Misra-Gries computes which value makes up the majority of the stream, or more generally, the set of items that constitute some fixed fraction of the stream.  

Count -Min Sketch 
Count-min sketch uses hash functions to map events to frequencies at the expense of over-counting some events due to collisions..
